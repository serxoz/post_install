### Linux Systems

The best thing about **Linux** is that you can install just a bases system or a full desktop enviroment. In here we like a minimal install of our linux and we use a *Tiling Window Manager*.

If you are new to this kind of installations and you don't know where to start, here is a list of tutorials that can help you to start with:

* Arch Linux - >
	* [Official Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide)
	* [Guide 2](https://arcolinuxd.com/5-the-actual-installation-of-arch-linux-phase-1-uefi/)
* Debian ->
	* [Official Guide](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/index.en.html) Debian is very easy to install.
* Void Linux ->
	* [Official Guide](https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/live-images/guide.html)
	* [Guide 2](http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/void/quickinst.htm)

# Post Installation

This is the script i use in my post installation. I use it for this *Linux Distros*:

* Arch Linux

* Void Linux

In this script **dwm** is my default tiling window manager to install. (you can comment out or delete the lines that install dwm if you don't want to install it)

This is the suckless software that will be install
